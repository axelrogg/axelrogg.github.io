# Welcome to my personal blog

This is where I decide to do all my brain vomiting. It's incredibly minimalistic
because I want to keep it simple and I want people to focus on the content
(although I don't count on other people than myself actually reading what I post).

Still many of things to figure out about the look and feel of the website, but
it's a working progress.

So that's it. If you ever find something I write and want to reach out, let me
know.
